# Thermodynamics_for_Hydrogen_Based_Shaft_Furnace

This code is designed to calculate the reduction thermodynamics for a hydrogen based shaft furnace. The effect of temperature, H2/CO ratio, methane content, water shift gas reaction were taken into account.

A detailed description of the calculation can be found in the following paper. If this calculation proves valuable to your research, please consider citing our work:
